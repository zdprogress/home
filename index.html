          Introduction

          Hi there my name is ZZIWA DERRICK <br />
          I am a person who loves using computers in this new generation where are somewhat a basic necessity 
          of life <br />
          Therefore due to the love i have about the new technologies in our new generation I have tried 
          to look for different courses about computers and in doing so I have found a lot of things that I,
          or almost all of us in this generation should learn
        </p>
        <p>
          If your new to computers you will have to learn the basics of how to use it for example learning each 
          function of a key on a keyboard and learn the funtions of each mouse button <br />
          You should also learn other computer basics like how to 
          <ul>
            <li>
              open a folder or a coputer programe
            </li>
            <li>
              navigate through the folders
            </li>
            <li>
              create, rename and delete a folder
            </li>
            <li>
              shutdown a computer and many other staff
            </li>
          </ul>
